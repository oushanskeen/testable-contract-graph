# Tool Value & Assessment

### Risks:
	Risk #1 Ambiguous or oversized tasks:
		→ slow delivery
		→ miscommunication
		→ unpredictable outcomes
	Risk #2 Missing or unclear dependencies:
		→ work is done out of order
		→ atomic tasks
	Risk #3 Non-verifiable tasks:
		→ unreliable outcomes
		→ accidental regressions
	Risk #4 Commit history that does not reflect planned structure:
		→ lose traceability → lose reproducibility
	Risk #5 Requirements drift (good intentions →  different implementation): 
		→ High-level business requirements often get lost or mutated.
	Risk 7 Lack of explicitness in iteration:
		→ Work often happens implicitly, not explicitly.
